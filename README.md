# LEADING 2021-2023 Data Science Lessons Archive

LEADING was the *LIS Education and Data Science-Integrated Network*, an IMLS sponsored project focused on the development of data science skills among early and mid-career information science professionals (IMLS RE-246450-OLS-20). The project was a collaboration among many institutions and organizations, and was led by Dr. Jane Greenberg at Drexel University. For more information about the project, see the [website hosted by Drexel University's Metadata Research Center](https://mrc.cci.drexel.edu/leading/).

A component of the project was an annual data science *boot camp*, during which project fellows completed three weeks of synchronous and asynchronous instruction in topics related to computation in an LIS research context. This repository is an archive of the lesson materials developed over the three years of the project, 2021-2023. A release of this repository will be published on Zenodo, and this README will be updated to include a citation to the Zenodo record.

The structure of the archive is described in more detail below. It is noted here that the archive is not a complete representation of the lesson materials as delivered during the boot camp. Content may have been excluded for reasons including but not limited to:

- Learner and participant privacy: For example, recordings of synchronous Zoom sessions have not been included.
- Copyrighted or other third party content: To the extent possible, citations and links have been added to provide reference to these materials.
- File size: Pre-recorded videos for asynchronous lessons have not been included due to file size limitations.
