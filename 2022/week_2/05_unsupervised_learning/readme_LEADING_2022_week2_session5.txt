## Included files

1. 10-LEADING-BootCamp-unsupervised.html
	- HTML rendering of the Jupyter Notebook used for the session.
2. Slides leading2022_unsupervised.pdf
	- Slide deck for the session. Topics include comparison of supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering methods, and k-means clustering.
3. unsupervised
	- Directory of session materials. Located at the root of the archive, at '../../../leading_archive/unsupervised'. This is a large dataset and is referenced by the unsupervised learning lesson each year. The dataset is included once for the sake of minimizing the size of the repository.
4. 10-LEADING-BootCamp-unsupervised.ipynb
	- Included in the '../../../leading_archive/unsupervised' directory. Jupyter Notebook titled "Unsupervised Learning." Includes explanations of machine learning, clustering algorithms, and an explanation and demonstration of k-means clustering.
5. glove.6B.50d.txt.zip
	- Included in the '../../../leading_archive/unsupervised/data/' directory. A set of pre-trained word vectors from the GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation project. Unzip to use. See citation below.
6. google_books-fs.npy.zip
	- Included in the '../../../leading_archive/unsupervised/data/' directory. Unzip to use. A Python array file.
7. google_books-ranks.json
	- Included in the '../../../leading_archive/unsupervised/data/' directory. Unzip to use. A JSON file containing key:values pairs of word ranks from Google Books.
8. msr.csv
	- Included in the '../../../leading_archive/unsupervised/data/' directory. Unzip to use. Syntactic test set of analogy questions, described in Mikolov, Yih, and Zweig (2013). Formerly available online at http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/rnn/default.aspx.
